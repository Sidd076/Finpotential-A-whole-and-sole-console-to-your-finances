                        <p>A fixed deposit or FD is an investment product offered by banks and Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs). In FDs, you invest for a set amount of time and get a fixed interest rate.
                            You know at the time of investing what interest rate you will get and how much money you will receive at the time of maturity. You also get an option of selecting regular pay-out of interest.
                            In a Fixed Deposit, you put a lump sum in your bank for a fixed tenure at an agreed rate of interest. At the end of the tenure, you receive the amount you have invested plus compound interest. FDs are also called term deposits. Interest rates.</p>

This period can be any random number of days (offered in Banks), such as 290 or 390. Due to the higher interest rates on special FDs, they are a popular investment option. </p>

                        <h4><u>How to Choose the Best Fixed Deposit?</u></h4><br />
                        <p>To choose the most suitable fixed deposit, depositors must evaluate certain aspects: </p>
                        <p><b>1. Term of the Fixed Deposit</b><br />FD interest rates vary with tenure; the more tenure, the higher the interest rate. FDs with longer terms may appear to be better, but since the deposited money is locked up for longer periods, the investor’s liquidity is hampered. Thus, it’s imperative to opt for an FD that offers tenure flexibility based on the depositor’s financial situation and goals.</p>
                        <p><b>2. Premature Withdrawal Terms</b><br />Before choosing a fixed deposit, it is advisable to evaluate the premature withdrawal terms and penalties. They should have the freedom to liquidate their FD and not at a very high price.</p>
                        <p><b>3. Rate of Interest</b><br />The main reason for opening FDs is to earn interest on them. Choose a financial institution that offers competitive FD interest rates.</p>
                        <p><b>4. Additional Benefits</b><br />Don’t just go by the interest rates; look for some added benefits. These include auto-renewal options, a facility of loan against the Fixed Deposit, an overdraft facility for high liquidity, and other such features.

                            There are various investment options available, yet Fixed deposits continue to be a favoured choice amongst investors. This is because the safe and secure nature of FDs guarantees fixed returns and stable growth. With different types of fixed deposits to choose from, depositors will find a suitable one for their money.</p>
