                    <p>A fund is a type of investment that collects money from many people. The money is subsequently used by fund managers to invest in a variety of stocks and bonds. Each investor is given units that represent a percentage of the fund's holdings.</p>
                    <h4>How Funds Work</h4>
                    <p>Individuals, businesses, and governments all use funds to set aside money. Individuals might establish an emergency fund—also called a rainy-day fund—to pay for unforeseen expenses or a trust fund to set aside money for a specific person.
<br/>
Individual and institutional investors can also place money in different types of funds with the goal of earning money. Examples include mutual funds, which gather money from numerous investors and invest it in a diversified portfolio of assets, and hedge funds, which invest the assets of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) and institutions in a way that is designed to earn above-market returns. Governments use funds, such as special revenue funds, to pay for specific public expenses.</p>
                    <h4>Types of Funds</h4>
                    <p>The following are examples of funds commonly used for personal ventures:</p>
                    <li><b>Emergency funds</b> are personal savings vehicles created by individuals used to cover periods of financial hardship, such as job loss, prolonged illness, or a major expense. The rule of thumb is to create an emergency fund that contains at least three months' worth of net income.</li>
                    <li><b>College funds</b> are usually tax-advantaged savings plans set up by families to allocate funds for their children’s college expenses.</li>
                    <li><b>Trust funds</b> are legal arrangements set up by a grantor who appoints a trustee to administer valuable assets for the benefit of a listed beneficiary for a period of time, after which all or a portion of the funds are released to the beneficiary or beneficiaries.</li>
                    <li><b>Retirement funds</b> are savings vehicles used by individuals saving for retirement. Retirees receive monthly income or pensions from retirement funds.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>How Do You Start a Fund?</h4>
                    <p>Depending on what type of fund you want to start will depend on how you start it. If it is an emergency fund, a simple way to start one is to set aside a small portion of money every week or month in a separate bank account. If you are interested in starting an investment fund, this is more complicated. You would first need to have a professional background, raise money to start the basics of a fund, such as incorporating it and any trading equipment, then you would need to decide on an investment strategy, then attract investors willing to invest capital into your fund.</p>
                    <h4>What Is an Example of a Fund?</h4>
                    <p>An example of a fund is a mutual fund. Mutual funds accept money from investors and use that money to invest in a variety of assets. Mutual funds have managers that manage the fund, which they charge a fee to investors for. Investors allocate money to mutual funds in hopes of increasing their wealth.</p>
