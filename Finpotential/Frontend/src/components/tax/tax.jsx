                    <p>A tax is a mandatory fee or financial charge levied by any government on an individual or an organization to collect revenue for public works providing the best facilities and infrastructure. The collected fund is then used to fund different public expenditure programs.<br /></p>
                    <h4>Types of Taxes</h4><br />
                    <p>Be it an individual or any business/organization, all have to pay the respective taxes in various forms. These taxes are further subcategorized into direct and indirect taxes depending on the manner in which they are paid to the taxation authorities.</p>
                   <ul> <li><b>Direct Tax:</b> A direct tax is a tax that a person or organization pays directly to the entity that imposed it. Examples include income tax, real property tax, personal property tax, and taxes on assets, all of which are paid by an individual taxpayer directly to the government.
                        <br />Direct taxes in the United States are largely based on the ability-to-pay principle. This economic principle states that those who have more resources or earn a higher income should bear a greater tax burden. Some critics see that as a disincentive for individuals to work hard and earn more money because the more a person makes, the more taxes they pay.

                        Direct taxes cannot be passed on to a different person or entity. The individual or organization upon which the tax is levied is responsible for paying it.
                       
                    </li>
                    <br />
                        <li><b>Indirect Tax:</b> Indirect tax is the tax levied on the consumption of goods and services. It is not directly levied on the income of a person. Instead, he/she has to pay the tax along with the price of goods or services bought by the seller.
                            <br />An indirect tax is collected by one entity in the supply chain, such as a manufacturer or retailer, and paid to the government; however, the tax is passed onto the consumer by the manufacturer or retailer as part of the purchase price of a good or service. The consumer is ultimately paying the tax by paying more for the product.
                            Indirect taxes are defined by contrasting them with direct taxes. Indirect taxes can be defined as taxation on an individual or entity, which is ultimately paid for by another person. The body that collects the tax will then remit it to the government. But in the case of direct taxes, the person immediately paying the tax is the person that the government is seeking to tax.
                            Excise duties on fuel, liquor, and cigarettes are all considered examples of indirect taxes.
                            <br />
                            By contrast, income tax is the clearest example of a direct tax, since the person earning the income is the one immediately paying the tax. Admission fees to a national park are another clear example of direct taxation.

                        <br/>
                        <h4>Why Do We Pay Taxes?</h4><br />
                        <p>Taxes are the primary source of revenue for most governments. Among other things, this money is spent to improve and maintain public infrastructure, including the roads we travel on, and fund public services, such as schools, emergency services, and welfare programs.</p>
