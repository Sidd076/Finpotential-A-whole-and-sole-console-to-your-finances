                        <p>Financial policies are the rules or principles of your business's accounting and financial practices. They should reflect your business's values and culture. Your procedures are the instructions that outline what your employees must do to abide by these policies.</p>
                        <h4>Types of Policy</h4><br />
                        <li><b>Hedging Policy:</b>Hedging policy involves offsetting the finance for an asset with a liability that matures on the asset’s expected life. For example, a business wants to purchase machinery having an expected life of 20 years. It can do so by financing the asset with a 20-year loan. This way, the asset and liability both will mature in the same period. The purpose of the hedging policy is to match the assets and liabilities during the relinquishing period.</li>
                        <li><b>Conservative Policy:</b>An organization’s attempt to match the assets with the liabilities is not always possible. In such situations, the business uses a conservative financing policy. In this policy, the firm uses more long-term sources of finance and less short-term finance to purchase its asset. The business acquires permanent and current assets using long-term sources of finances. Only a part of short-term finance is used to finance its temporary current assets.</li>
                        <li><b>Aggressive Policy:</b>Aggressive financing policy comprises of relying more on short-term sources of finance than long-term sources. It is termed an aggressive policy because it is riskier as it involves the continuous renewal of the borrowing. In this policy, the firm finances its permanent current assets using short-term sources of finance.</li>
                        <li><b>Highly Aggressive Policy:</b>A highly aggressive financing policy is one where long-term sources finance the major part of the permanent asset, and short-term sources finance a minor portion. It is a common assumption that the firms which follow this policy are nearing their closure and are termed as “sick.”</li>
                        <h4>Financing Policy Decisions </h4><br />
                        <li><b>Investment Decisions:</b>Investment decisions of the organization depend on the long-term or short-term investment requirements. The long-term investment decision involves investment in the organization’s capital assets, and the short-term investment decision involves working capital management. The firm’s financing policy considers the investment requirements and accordingly arranges for the funds. The interest rates on the long-term funds are comparatively lower than the short-term funds.</li>
                        <li><b>Financing Decisions:</b>he finance manager of an organization needs to select those sources of finance that result in optimum and efficient capital structure. The duty of the finance manager is to select the right proportion of debt and equity in the overall capital mix—higher debt results in higher interest liability and higher risk. By increasing the equity, permanent funds of the business will increase. Still, it will also result in higher expectations of the shareholders in the form of a higher required rate of return. The financing decisions are based on increasing the wealth of shareholders and the organization’s profitability.</li>
                        <li><b>Dividend Decisions:</b>Distributing dividends is an important aspect of the business while determining the financing policy. The major concern while making dividend decisions is determining how much profits are available to distribute to the shareholders. Dividend decisions must be based on dividend stability policy and future outlook.</li>
