                    <h1>Finance Management</h1>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>Financial management is strategic planning, organising, directing, and controlling of financial undertakings in an organisation or an institute. It also includes applying management principles to the financial assets of an organisation, while also playing an important part in fiscal management.<br/>Financial management is strategically planning how a business should earn and spend money. This includes decisions about raising capital, borrowing money and budgeting. Financial management also involves setting financial goals and analysing data.When banks face financial trouble, they may reach the central bank for policy changes that can keep them running. This may include raising taxes or aiming to reduce non-performing assets.   </p>
                    <h4><u>Types of Financial Management</u> </h4>
                    <h4>1.Capital budgeting</h4>
                    <p>Employing funds in different assets is integral to any organisation. Long-term investment decisions affect profitability and liquidity. Hence they are generally irreversible and struggle to maintain the organisation’s dignity. 

For example, to cope with competition, Mahindra made long term decisions to invest in electric vehicles. This decisive decision can potentially change the course of the Indian automobile sector or can backflip if not done right. Bad capital budgeting can destabilize their financial fortune and affect their position in the stock market. </p>
                    <h4>2.Capital structure</h4>
                    <p>Sourcing funds to ensure smooth functioning is the quintessential decision organisations need to make. Raising funds from long-term sources includes equity, shares, debentures, bank loans, etc. Capital structure essentially considers the risks involved in the repayment of such borrowed funds. 

The cost of raising/repaying capital varies, and so does the risk associated with it. Additionally, floatation costs like commissions, brokerage, etc., make funding less appealing.  </p>

                    <h4>3.Dividend decision</h4>
                    <p>Profit distribution determines how well a company understands and regards contributions. Sharing dividends among shareholders involves devising an approach determined by the dividend per share. Normally, it does not change concerning minor changes in profits.

Dividend sharing also determines a company’s growth prospects and cash flow positions. Availability of adequate cash is crucial, especially when the economy is vulnerable to fluctuations. </p>

                    <h4>4.Working capital management decision</h4>
                    <p>It involves effectively employing an organisation’s available working capital. Companies need to analyse their assets and liabilities for a stable cash flow. This would eventually assist them in meeting short term debt obligations and maintaining production costs. 

Working capital management works with several financial ratios that can effectively ensure the smooth operation of the cash conversion cycle. </p>
                
                <h4><u>The Five A’s of Financial Management</u></h4>
                <li><b>Anticipation of funds:</b>Financing a business from the beginning involves capital requirements. As a major factor of production, labour intensive work requires regular payment salary income and the company must acquire/produce revenue to meet the requirements. Companies may also introduce a capital structure consisting of debts, common equity, etc.  </li>
                <li><b>Acquisition of funds:</b>Fund acquisition succeeds anticipation in the natural order of dealing with capital. Companies may obtain funding from internal sources like owner’s investment, fixed assets and retained earnings or from financial institutions, shares and bonds, etc.  </li>
                <li><b>Allocation of funds:</b>The decision to invest is evaluated on safety, liquidity, and profitability. So assessing risks is important. Funds must then be invested in areas that require capital to continue operations. Companies invest a lot of funds in research and development purposes as well. Mahindra could never reach a milestone in the automobile world if it could not assess situations and invest in research. </li>
                <li><b>Appropriation of funds: </b>Finance experts believe that an organisation should learn to manage its funds efficiently. This also involves profit and dividend management.</li>
                <li><b>Assessment of plans and policies:</b> Managing finances includes analysing and controlling all financial instruments and the annual balance sheet data. It helps identify if the company is secure and productive. It also serves shareholders’ interests by evaluating policies and guidelines. </li>
                
                <br/>
                <h4><u>The Objective of Financial Management </u></h4>
                <p>Some basic objectives or perks of efficient financial management include:</p>
                <li><b>Profit maximization and wealth management:</b>Organizations function with the principal objective of earning maximum profits. Higher profits ensure capital accumulation and brighter prospects. It also ensures that the company’s shareholders are satisfied with their involvement. Dividend sharing, for example, preserves goodwill and improves the company’s performance in the share market. </li>
                <li><b>Liquidity management and proper mobilization:</b> Monitoring liquidity is important because it helps deal with uncertainty. Imagine a bank that has most of its reserves given as loans, and it is struggling to pay customers their deposit amounts. It should either borrow from the RBI to feed its liquidity or release public bonds. This also implies that companies should be able to finance their funds through multiple sources like shares, debentures and bonds, etc. </li>
                <li><b>Meeting financial commitments and boosting efficiency: </b>Timed payment of dues is a practice that efficient financial managers exercise. This highlights their goodwill and manages financial commitments with ease. Moreover, it helps create a substantial reserve to enable an optimal dividend pay-out policy in the long run.</li>
